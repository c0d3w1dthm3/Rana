Broken Auth: 

# Names 
- Auth Flaw
> Auth is when it confirms the user is who they say they are. 


# Types

- HTML form-based authentication
- Multi-factor mechanisms


# Flaws

******** Weak Password Requirements ********

Having no or minimal controls over the quality of users' passwords.
- very short
- common dictionary words or Names
- use of default passwords
- missing or ineffective MFA

******** Improper Restriction of Authentication Attempts ********

Applucation permits brute force or other automated attacks.
- login page
- OTP / MFA page
- Change Password page

******** Verbose Error Message ********

The application outputs a verbose error message that allows for username enumeration

- 'incorrect username'
- 'incorrect password'
- 'this name already exsists'

******** Vulnerable Transmission of Credentials ********

- HTTPS vs HTTPS
The application uses an unencrupted HTTP connection to transmit login credentials









# Note:

1. 
>If customer is using off-the-shelf online software > check to see if the software ships with default credentials.
- if it does then test those default creds against usernames -->> look up the default creds for that software

2.
Look up users email accounts & see if there have been breaches that they've been apart of & then check if those sync
with their daily passwords ( netflex, instagram, etc ) -->> CHECK the CASMM as a guide
